### User Guide

This guide is meant as a simplified version of the firmware README, with information that is up-to-date and relevant to Rana Digital users.

#### Modes

This is not an exhaustive list of all the modes available in the pico-rectangle firmware but it should contain the ones that are useful to the vast majority of users.

##### (Coming Soon)

#### Remapping

To enter remapping mode, hold down the highlighted key shown below when plugging in the controller.  Release the key within 3 seconds of plugging in.

After 3 seconds have passed, press the keys in the following order, corresponding to your preferred layout:

 - L
 - Left
 - Down 
 - Right
 - MX
 - MY
 - Start
 - CLeft
 - CDown
 - CUp
 - A
 - CRight
 - R
 - B
 - Y
 - X
 - LS
 - Z
 - MS
 - Up
 - DpadToggle/Up2 (depending on the mode)

Once all 21 keys have been pressed, unplug the controller and plug it in again.  If done correctly, it will now have your updated key mapping saved.  The mapping will not reset to default upon updating the firmware.
